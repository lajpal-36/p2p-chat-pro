# P2P Dark Chat Application Dependencies
# This is a client-side HTML application that runs entirely in the browser

# External CDN Dependencies (loaded via script tags):
# - PeerJS v1.5.2 (https://unpkg.com/peerjs@1.5.2/dist/peerjs.min.js)

# No server-side dependencies required for basic deployment
# The application uses:
# - Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
# - CSS3 with custom properties
# - HTML5 APIs (clipboard, localStorage)
# - WebRTC (via PeerJS) for peer-to-peer communication

# For local development server (optional):
# python -m http.server 8000
# or
# npx serve .

# For GitHub Pages deployment:
# No additional requirements - just upload the HTML file

# Security Note:
# Consider hosting PeerJS locally instead of using CDN for production
